        <h2>Alban Analysis A</h2>

        <p>

            The soccer team is a known powerhouse in the ivy prep league. And they would CRUSH the known terrible 1-13 OVER A WHOLE SEASON varsity bball team. 
            They are unable to play their OWN SPORT and dare challenge Fifi's squad. We are known for winning, with only 7 losses in the last 3 years, WHICH IS BARELY
            ABOVE HALF OF YOUR LOSSES LAST YEAR. You guys are frauds at basketball and think you can play soccer? Your striker, Cooper, has been the only one with soccer
            experience, most of which is in one game a year. Kader is a fraud at soccer. Matt Frat would be a similarly talented keeper to Ian, who in 2023, conceded 9 penalties
            in a row to 4 year starter, 2 time ivy prep league first team, nysais & league winner, finalist, WEB APP DEV STUDENT, and captain Alban Maurel. 

        </p>

        <h3>Ian's Inalysis I</h3>

        <p> 

            In the best possible world (which isn't this one) the soccer team pulls out a narrow 3-2 victory due to slightly more experience.
